## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Material UI
- **Backend:** Express.js, Node.js
- **Database:** MongoDB


## Getting Started
The MERN Application is designed in such a way that client and server communicate with each other when both of their services run concurrently. Both Client(project_ui in File Directory) and Server(project_backend in file directory) are developed separately.

The Database MongoDB is hosted on the Cloud, so no local setup is required to fetch the data from the DB.

Steps to run the Application
1. Clone the Repository to your local machine.
2. To run the application, Both the services (Client and Server) needs to executed concurrently in separate terminals.
3. Steps to Run Client
    a. Navigate to the project_ui folder i.e. "cd project_ui"
    b. Run "npm install" to install all dependencies and libraries to your local. The libraries will be installed in "node_modules" folder.
    c. Run "npm start" to run the Client Service.
    d. The Client Application started running in PORT #3000. Ensure the port is free in your machine.
4. Steps to Run Server
    a. Navigate to the project_backend folder i.e. "cd project_backend".
    b. Run "npm install" to install all dependencies and libraries to your local. The libraries will be installed in "node_modules" folder.
    c. Run "npm run dev" to run the Server Service.
    d. The Server Application is running in PORT #8888. Ensure the port is free your machine.
5. - Server API is running at http://localhost:SERVER_PORT (http://localhost:8888 by default)
   - Web client is running at http://localhost:CLIENT_PORT (http://localhost:3000 by default)
6. Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to access the application.
7. You are all set to use the application.
